# washing_machine_control_panel

This project was started from an attempt to replace a broken logic board in my washing machine. A small project was created with an Arduino microcontroller and relays to rewire all the mechanical components and control them programmatically from the Arduino software. It turns out that the ammount of memory and input or output pins is very limited, resulting in a great limitation for usability. This repository contains a mobile application for Android devices that is able to customize the washing cycles and only requires a USB connection (via OTG) to apply the profile created on the phone via serial connection.

This is a WIP on early stages of development, the code for both Android and Arduino side should be pushed soon to this repo.
